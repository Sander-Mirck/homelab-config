# Homelab Configurations

These are all my docker-compose files for my homelab. I have hidden most configurations for most services because they contain sensitive information. It may be the case for some services that they don't contain sensitive information, but I don't really have the time to look through it in detail. I may do this later.

### Remote Access

I access my homelab externally with **Tailscale**. It's very easy, and you don't have to expose any ports on your router. I have previously always used Nextcloud tunnels, but it became an issue with Jellyfin and transcoding.

### Hardware

I run everything on my **Raspberry Pi 5**. Furthermore, I'm currently looking to expand.
